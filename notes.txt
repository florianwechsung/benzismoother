* Custom prolong/restrict, etc...

Need to attach these to the DM that's made in a FunctionSpace.

Add method to FunctionSpace for user to provide
prolong/restriction/injection overriding the defaults.

Refactor so defaults are delivered through this mechanism first.

Then you'll need to make sure these are propagated to coarse grid
DM/FunctionSpace objects.

See functionspaceimpl.FunctionSpace._dm for where the DM is currently
created.

And dmhooks.py for where the hook attachment is done.
